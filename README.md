# IPL Score Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict the total score of a cricket team at the end of their innings during an IPL (Indian Premier League) match. The model is built using historical data from IPL seasons 1 to 9 (2008-2016) and tested on data from season 10 (2017). The model uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the score based on input features such as the batting and bowling teams, overs, runs, wickets, and other match statistics.
